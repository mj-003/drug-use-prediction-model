# Drug Classification Project

This report aims to explore data analysis methods in the context of drug use, utilizing advanced predictive models based on demographic, personality, and health-related data. By analyzing these factors and their interconnections, we aim to identify determinants of drug use risk and predict such behavior based on available data. The full report detailing the steps, results, and conclusions of the project can be found in the `drugs_raport.pdf` file.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict drug classification based on available features. The dataset used is preprocessed and cleaned, followed by the application of classification algorithms to evaluate their performance. The report provides detailed insights into the methods, models, and results obtained throughout the project.

## Libraries Used

This project utilizes the following libraries:

- **NumPy** - used for numerical operations and handling arrays and matrices.

- **Pandas** - used for data manipulation and analysis, especially for handling structured data.

- **Matplotlib** - used for data visualization, specifically for creating static, interactive, and animated plots.

- **Seaborn** - built on top of Matplotlib, used for statistical data visualization with enhanced plotting features.

- **Scikit-learn** - this project uses various modules from Scikit-learn, a key library for machine learning:
